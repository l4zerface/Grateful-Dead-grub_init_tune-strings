Grateful-Dead-grub_init_tune-strings

A collection of Grateful Dead inspired GRUB_INIT_TUNE strings. Pouring light into ashes and such.

Place the string into /etc/default/grub, use "grub-mkconfig" to regenerate your GRUB configuration file, take a massive bongrip and reboot.

[Note : At this time, I have not tested these strings on hardware. They were created using BreadMaker's amazing GRUB_INIT_TUNE tester and were not tested further.]

Please visit the following sites to learn to play and create your own strings:
